# 3point5percent Project Overview

## What is 3point5percent

**3point5percent** is a curated newsletter focused on grassroots community action, local policy innovation, and positive resistance to harmful federal policies. It highlights stories of faith communities, legal advocates, local organizers, educators and ordinary citizens who are taking constructive action to protect their neighbors and uphold their values, transforming passive, sometimes debilitating concern into active community engagement and a force for good.

## Vision & Mission

**VISION** *(The world we're working toward)*
A world where positive change feels possible, not paralizing - where people see proof that ordinary citizens are creating extraordinary progress from wherever they stand.

**MISSION** *(What we do to get there)*
We curate the local wins, creative solutions, and community victories that prove change is happening everywhere. Think of it as your weekly spot of positive that reminds you: if they can do it, so can we.

## The Idea

This project could fill a niche in progressive media by focusing specifically on **constructive community action** rather than pure political opposition. While most progressive newsletters focus on outrage and resistance, 3point5percent highlights **solutions in action**, providing readers with both inspiration and practical models for their own communities.

The curation system ensures consistent quality and editorial focus while scaling efficiently, positioning the newsletter as a reliable source for positive organizing stories that mainstream media often overlooks.

This project represents a lean approach to automated news curation in the progressive media space, combining content analysis with clear editorial vision to serve communities seeking constructive action models and inspiring success stories.
